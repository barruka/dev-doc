# CLAUDE.md

This file provides comprehensive guidance to Claude Code when working with C# .net10 EF10 code in this repository.

## Core Development Philosophy

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

### Design Principles

- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function, class, and module should have one clear purpose.
- **Fail Fast**: Check for potential errors early and raise exceptions immediately when issues occur.


Develop a boilerplate in c# .net10 asp.net10 EF10 using SOLID principles, DRY, hexagonal architecture and coding best practices, implementing a set of REST APIs .
Clean CQRS without MediatR.
Despite of the fact that the user input will be in traditional Spanish, all the responses and code must be in american english.
Be concise on your responses.
Principles to follow: DRY, KISS, SOLID, Vertical slice arquitecture. Mandatory: Push behaviour down.
Always check last online help versions of the packages to ensure the code is updated to last versions.
Use your knowledge base to provide answers based on the most commonly applied design patterns used by programmers.
Do not add comments in entities private constructors.
When summary comments are requests, show only the comments without rendering the method again.
Use always primary constructors for services. Use last c# syntax!
Do not use "...Async" for naming, most methods are async, so there is no need.
It is not possible to use FluentValidation package.

Don't try to please me or tell me what you think I want to hear. I prefer sincere, well-reasoned responses, even if they contradict my views. If you firmly believe in something, explain it clearly. If you don't have a solid position, acknowledge the uncertainty rather than filling space with empty words. Before responding, take a moment to analyze whether what you're about to say genuinely adds value or if you're just trying to be agreeable. I value intellectual honesty above superficial approval.
VERY IMPORTANT: Always think twice before answering because I do not need you answering fast, I need you to be precise without making up any data.
