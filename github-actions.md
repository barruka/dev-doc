# GitHub Actions

## Prerequisites
Install git in your local computer

## Procedure
1. Create a repository in GitHub
2. Copy the link of the repository. Ex: https://github.com/barruka/test-github-actions.git
3. In your local computer, clone the repository:
    1. Open command line
    2. Navigate to a folder where you want to store locally the repository
    3. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/barruka/test-github-actions.git`
5. Navigate to the folder. It must be empty because the repository was empty, newly created
6. Copy the code of your application to this folder. There is other possibilities to directly add github as a remote to an existing folder, but this is the EASY WAY (it's up to you)
7.
